* v0.3.0
- add support for form factor files from NIST (useful for energies
  above 30 keV)
- adds a tool to download all data from NIST (files are shipped with
  the libraries though)  
- do not return NaN below 30 eV (lower energies defined in Henke
  files)
* v0.2.1
- Elements now have a density field as well, which can be handed to the
  ~init~ call (in the future we might look them up as well).
- Compounds can also be given a density in the ~compound~ macro by
  providing a ~ρ~ or ~density~ argument.
- The ~DepthGradedMultilayer~ type takes care of constructing the
  correct refractive indices & layers for such a coating.
- add ~depthGradedLayers~ helper to compute the layer thicknesses
  according to the equations for depth graded layers
- export ~ρ~ field for compounds
- add ~density~ for gas mixtures to get density of the mixture
- add ~transmission~ to compute the transmission of gas mixtures      
* v0.2.0
- add ~refractedAngle~, ~refractedAngleSin~ to get refracted angle
  after an interface (and the ~sin(θ_j)~ in the latter case)
- add ~energy~ to convert a wavelength back to an energy
- add support for depth graded multilayer reflections, i.e. like the
  LLNL telescope (NuSTAR optic)
- improve ~reflectivity~ implementation
- allow calculation of refractive indices for compounds  
* v0.1.3
- add ~transmission~ overload for convenience taking a compound,
  density, length and energy
* v0.1.2
- add ~FluroscenceLine~ type and CSV file:
  CSV file contains all known X-ray fluorescence lines and their
  intensities. Using ~getFluorescenceLines~ the user can get all lines,
  their names and their relative intensities (be careful to
  normalize!).
- add ~GasMixture~ type and option to compute absorption length and
  attenuation coefficient for a gas mixture
* v0.1.1
- fix attenuation coefficient interpolation from NIST data
- use NIST attenuation coefficients for > 30 keV for now instead of
  computing from f1, f2
- allow more parameters in plotting of attenuation and transmission
- change naming of some resource files  
* v0.1.0
- initial release with basic features
