* v0.1.3
- add ~transmission~ overload for convenience taking a compound,
  density, length and energy
* v0.1.2
- add ~FluroscenceLine~ type and CSV file:
  CSV file contains all known X-ray fluorescence lines and their
  intensities. Using `getFluorescenceLines` the user can get all lines,
  their names and their relative intensities (be careful to
  normalize!).
- add ~GasMixture~ type and option to compute absorption length and
  attenuation coefficient for a gas mixture
* v0.1.1
- fix attenuation coefficient interpolation from NIST data
- use NIST attenuation coefficients for > 30 keV for now instead of
  computing from f1, f2
- allow more parameters in plotting of attenuation and transmission
- change naming of some resource files  
* v0.1.0
- initial release with basic features
